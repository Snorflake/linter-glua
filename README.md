linter-glua
===========

> gluac â€” The gluac is a variant of the luac, which parses (Garry's Mod) lua files. It can be used for detecting errors in lua code. See [http://www.lua.org/manual/4.0/luac.html](http://www.lua.org/manual/4.0/luac.html) for more informations about luac.

This package will lint your `.lua` opened files in Atom through luac or [luajit](http://luajit.org/running.html).  **It will lint on edit and/or save**, so you'll see instantly if your code has errors.

Due to the way that luac works it will only notify you of the first error found in the file.

## Linter Installation
